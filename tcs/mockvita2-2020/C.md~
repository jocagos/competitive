# Philaland Coin

## Problem Description

The problem solvers have found a new island for coding and named it as Philaland.

These smart people were given a task to make purchase of the items at the island easier by distributing various coins with different value.

Manish has come up with a solution that, if we make the coins categories starting from $1 till the maximum price of the item present on the Island, then we can purchase any item easily. He added the following example to prove his point.

Let's suppose the maximum price of an item is $5, then we can make coins with denominations {$1, $2, $3, $4, $5} to purchase any item ranging from $1 to $5.
